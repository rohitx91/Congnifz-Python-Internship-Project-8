## 📌 Project Overview
This project automates file organization by scanning a folder and categorizing files based on their file types (Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives).  
The script automatically creates folders and moves files into their respective categories.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Python automation concepts  
- Explore `os` and `shutil` modules  
- Manage directories programmatically  
- Automate repetitive tasks efficiently  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **os** (file system handling)
- **shutil** (file movement)
- **Automation logic**

## 📂 How It Works
1. Place all files inside the `to_sort` folder  
2. Run the script  
3. The program automatically:
   - Creates category folders  
   - Sorts and moves files into proper folders
